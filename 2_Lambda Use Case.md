AWS Lambda is a versatile compute service that excels in scenarios requiring rapid scaling and dynamic resource management. Here are key scenarios where Lambda is ideal:

1. **File Processing**:
   - **Use Case**: Automate data processing in real-time when files are uploaded to Amazon S3.
   - **Example**: Resizing images or processing video files upon upload.

2. **Stream Processing**:
   - **Use Case**: Process real-time streaming data for various applications.
   - **Examples**:
     - **Application Activity Tracking**: Monitor user interactions in real-time.
     - **Transaction Order Processing**: Handle and validate transaction data streams.
     - **Clickstream Analysis**: Analyze user behavior on websites.
     - **Data Cleansing and Log Filtering**: Cleanse incoming data streams or filter logs before storage.
     - **Indexing and Social Media Analysis**: Real-time data indexing and sentiment analysis.
     - **IoT Data Telemetry and Metering**: Collect and analyze data from IoT devices.

3. **Web Applications**:
   - **Use Case**: Build scalable web applications that can automatically adjust to traffic demands.
   - **Example**: E-commerce websites or dynamic content platforms.

4. **IoT Backends**:
   - **Use Case**: Manage backend processes for IoT devices without managing servers.
   - **Example**: Processing and responding to data from IoT sensors or devices.

5. **Mobile Backends**:
   - **Use Case**: Build backends for mobile apps that handle API requests and authentication.
   - **Example**: Backend services for mobile apps using AWS Amplify, API Gateway, and Lambda.

**Responsibility**: When using Lambda, your only responsibility is to write and manage your code. AWS handles the underlying infrastructure, scaling, and execution environment.
