The **Lambda handler** is the function in your AWS Lambda code that AWS Lambda calls to start execution of your code. This handler function processes the input event data and returns a response. When you create a Lambda function, you define the handler as an entry point for the Lambda service to invoke your function.

### **Key Components of a Lambda Handler:**

1. **Function Signature**: The Lambda handler function typically has two parameters:
   - **`event`**: This parameter holds the input data that the Lambda function receives. It can be a JSON-formatted object or any other format, depending on the event source (e.g., S3, DynamoDB, API Gateway).
   - **`context`**: This parameter provides runtime information about the Lambda function itself, such as request ID, log group, and timeout settings. It also allows you to interact with AWS services and track the remaining time before the function times out.

   Example:
   ```python
   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       # Your code logic here
       return {
           'statusCode': 200,
           'body': 'Hello, world!'
       }
   ```

2. **Event**: The event object passed to the handler contains the input data that triggered the Lambda function. For example, if an S3 event triggers the function, the event object will contain details about the S3 bucket and the object that was uploaded or modified.

   Example event data for an S3 trigger:
   ```json
   {
       "Records": [
           {
               "s3": {
                   "bucket": {
                       "name": "my-bucket"
                   },
                   "object": {
                       "key": "my-object"
                   }
               }
           }
       ]
   }
   ```

3. **Context**: The context object provides information about the runtime environment. Some of the commonly used attributes include:
   - **`context.aws_request_id`**: A unique identifier for each request.
   - **`context.log_group_name`**: The CloudWatch Log Group name.
   - **`context.log_stream_name`**: The CloudWatch Log Stream name.
   - **`context.get_remaining_time_in_millis()`**: The amount of time remaining before the function times out, in milliseconds.

   Example usage:
   ```python
   def lambda_handler(event, context):
       remaining_time = context.get_remaining_time_in_millis()
       print(f"Remaining time: {remaining_time} ms")
       return {
           'statusCode': 200,
           'body': 'Hello, world!'
       }
   ```

### **Naming the Lambda Handler:**

When you create a Lambda function, you specify the handler name. The handler name includes the file name (without the `.py` extension) and the function name separated by a dot (`.`).

For example, if you have a Python file named `my_lambda.py` and the handler function is `lambda_handler`, you would specify the handler as:

```plaintext
my_lambda.lambda_handler
```

### **How the Handler Works:**

1. **Lambda Execution**: When an event triggers your Lambda function, AWS Lambda automatically invokes the handler function you defined.
2. **Processing**: The handler receives the event data and processes it according to your logic.
3. **Response**: After processing, the handler returns a response to the Lambda service, which can be a simple message, a JSON object, or even data that triggers another process.

### **Example Lambda Handler:**

```python
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    s3_client = boto3.client('s3')
    bucket_name = event['Records'][0]['s3']['bucket']['name']
    object_key = event['Records'][0]['s3']['object']['key']
    
    # Process the S3 object here (e.g., read, move, delete, etc.)
    response = s3_client.get_object(Bucket=bucket_name, Key=object_key)
    
    print(f"Processed object: {object_key} from bucket: {bucket_name}")
    
    return {
        'statusCode': 200,
        'body': f'Successfully processed {object_key} from {bucket_name}'
    }
```

### **Summary:**

- The **Lambda handler** is the entry point for your AWS Lambda function.
- It processes the incoming event data and returns a response.
- It consists of two parameters: `event` (input data) and `context` (runtime information).
- You define the handler in the AWS Management Console, CLI, or your deployment configuration.
