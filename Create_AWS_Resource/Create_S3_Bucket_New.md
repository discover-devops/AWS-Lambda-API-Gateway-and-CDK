### creating an AWS Lambda function that creates an S3 bucket. Here's a summary of the key steps involved:

### 1. Create a New Lambda Function
- Go to the AWS Lambda console.
- Click on "Create function" and select "Author from scratch."
- Provide a name for your function (e.g., `mydemo_Create_S3`).
- Choose Python 3.9 as the runtime.
- Leave the default execution role settings and click "Create function."

### 2. Increase the Timeout Limit
- Navigate to the "Configuration" tab and select "General configuration."
- Edit the timeout setting to 1 minute, then save the changes.

### 3. Enhance the IAM Role
- Go to the "Permissions" tab and click on the role name linked to the Lambda function.
- Attach the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy to allow the function to create and manage S3 buckets.

### 4. Write the Lambda Function Code
- Use the `boto3` library to interact with AWS services.
- Import `boto3` and create a client connection to the S3 service.
- Write the code to create an S3 bucket with the following key attributes:
  - `Bucket`: Name of the bucket.
  - `CreateBucketConfiguration`: Specifies the region for the bucket.

Example code:
```python
import boto3

def lambda_handler(event, context):
    client = boto3.client('s3')
    
    # Create S3 bucket
    response = client.create_bucket(
        Bucket='my_demo_09098999',
        CreateBucketConfiguration={
            'LocationConstraint': 'ap-southeast-2'  # Sydney region
        }
    )
    
    # Print response for verification
    print(response)
```

### 5. Test the Lambda Function
- Deploy the function.
- Create a test event and run the function.
- Verify that the S3 bucket is created by checking the S3 console.
- Check the CloudWatch logs to see the response from the `create_bucket` API call.

### 6. Verify the Created Bucket
- Go to the S3 console to verify that the bucket was successfully created with the specified name and region.

This approach ensures that your Lambda function has the necessary permissions and configuration to create an S3 bucket. By following these steps, you should be able to manage S3 buckets using AWS Lambda efficiently.
